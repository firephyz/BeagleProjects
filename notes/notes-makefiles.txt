Automatic special variables:
  Variants
    $@ - target full name
    $% - if rule == <archive>(<member-file>), then this is <member-file>
    $< - name of the first prereq. Note that implicit rules might append prereqs that will be returned first instead.
    $? - names of all prereqs newer than target
    $^ - names of all prereqs
    $+ - same as '$^' but with duplicate prereqs included instead of filtered out like normal
    $| - all order-only prereqs
    $* - stem of the target wildcard match (use of '%')
  Usage Modifiers
    Special variables of the form '$'<char> (like above) can be modified with (D|F) like this: '$('<char>(D|F)')'. This
      can be used to fetch the 'directory part' or 'file-name part' of the original normal special variable.
      - '$(@D)' for example, will return the 'D'irectory part of the $@ variable with the trailing slash removed.

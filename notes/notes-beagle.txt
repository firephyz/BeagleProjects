Imagine an object needs some data A to accomplish a member function. It could hold a personal copy of A (which
  may not always be necessary), or it could pass A in to the function as it needs it. You could also have a
  language construct that conveys the notion of a <temporarily given thing by some prescribed method> that comes
  along with the object (declared as part of the object?).

Booting
  MMC:
    mmc0 is SD card
    mmc1 is eMMC
  S1 : warm reset
  S2 : Pushing S2 toggles the 3rd bit to a zero
    0 : sysboot(403c) : pushed     boot_order(SPI, MMC0, USB, UART)
    1 : sysboot(4038) : not pushed boot_order(MMC1, MMC0, UART, USB)
  S3 : Reset PMU
  
  Sysboot is latched on a cold reset (saved across warm resets)

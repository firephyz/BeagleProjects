Instruction Fetch Process:
  1. Processor issues instruction fetch.
  2. Simultaeously does the following:
        * Translates VA via TLB. If protection check fails, the fetch
          aborts.
            VAs use Secure or Non-secure TLBs depending on the processor
          state.
        * Looks up address in L1 cache.
  3. Returns L1 hit, otherwise PA (post-translation) is passed to L2
     cache.
  4. Returns L2 hit, otherwise issues AXI transaction to fetch from
     external memory.
          Non-secure access: If processor is in Non-secure mode or in
          secure mode and memory location has non-secure attribute.
          Secure access: If processor is in secure state and memory
          location has secure attribute.

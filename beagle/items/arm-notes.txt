A1. Introduction
  Instruction Sets
    ARMv7 and below, only 32-bit
    Thumb
      16-bit extension for increased code density at the cost of execution time
      Includes a subset of the ARM functionality
      Thumb-2 after ARMv6T2
        Adds some 32-bit instructions to bring performance close to default 32-bit ARM (not THUMB)

	??? "Add both the half-precision extension and fused multiply-add instructions to features of VFPv3..."
	  Does this mean VFPv4 (full or not) always supports the VFPv3 half-precision extensions?
    SIMD
      If VFPv3, then support SIMDv1
      If VFPv4, then support SIMDv2
      If VFP uses half-precision, then so must the SIMD extension

  Applications execute at PL0 (lowest priviledge level)
  Data Types
    32-bit pointers
    signed or unsigned 64,32,16 or 8 bit integers
      64-bit integers held in two registers
    Packed registers (two 16-bit integers or 4 8-bit integers)
    Load/Stores move 32-bits or lower (sign extending as necessary)
    Other nuances with packed registers and 64-bit integers... see below
  Integer Arithmetic
    LSL_C (shift > 0)  logical left shift, produce carry
    LSL   (shift >= 0) logical left shift, discard carry
    LSR_C (shift > 0)  logical right shift, produce carry
    LSR   (shift >= 0) logical right shift, discard carry
    ASR_C (shift > 0)  arith. right shift, signed-preserving LSR
    ASR   (shift > 0)  arith. right shift, signed-preserving LSR
    ROR_C (shift != 0) rotate right, produce carry from last shifted-off right bit
    ROR                rotate right, discard carry
    RRX_C              LSR_C by 1, introduce optional bit on left to extend, produce last shifted-off bit as carry
    RRX                LSR_C by 1, introduce optional bit on left to extend, discard potential carry
    Addition and Subtraction ...
    Saturating Arithmetic ...
  ARM Core Registers
    R0-R12 (13 general purpose)
    SP (R13) stack register. THUMB instructions generally can only use R13 as the stack pointer. ARM is more general.
    LR (R14) link register. Holds return link information.
    PC (R15) program counter. Reads <address of current instruction> + <word size>. THUMB generally cannot utilize this. ARM is more general.
      Writing to PC
        Lowest bits are tied to ground as necessary to produce word aligned or halfword aligned addresses.
	Branch related instructions. BLX (already ensures value written to PC has correct alignment).
	THUMB: ADD and MOV instructions (bit 0 tied to ground to force halfword alignment).
	Others...
	Load writes to PC function similar to branch-change-ISA-states
	ALU writes to PC function similar to branch-change-ISA-states (ONLY if coming from ARM).
	Exceptions and Exception returns (or similar PC & CPSR writing instrs).
    APSR (application program status register)
      In v7-A and v7-R, the APSR is the same as the CPSR but APSR can only be used to access NZCVQ,GE...

   Execution State
     Functionality
       ISETSTATE : Controls ISA mode (ARM, THUMB, ThumbEE or Jazelle).
         Bitfield JT - 00=ARM, 01=THUMB, 10=Jazelle, 11=ThumbEE
       ITSTATE : In Thumb, it contains condition codes that apply to the IT instruction
         Bitfield IT[7:0]
	   7:5 - holds 3-bit base condition. If 3'b0, no IT block is active.
	   4:0 - <condition-code LSBs for each instruction> & 1'b1 & <4 - num-IT-instrs>'b0.
	         i.e. 01100, 2 instruction block, Instr1 cond-code LSB is 0, Instr2 cond-code LSB is 1.
         This field is LSL'ed by 1 every time an IT block instruction is executed.
	 Branches may only occur as the last instruction in the block so that ITSTATE always advances to normal execution.
       ENDIANSTATE : Data endianess. 0=little, 1=big
         See SETEND <BE|LE> instruction to set endian state in ARM or THUMB. Unconditional.
     in v7-A and v7-R, these are part of the CPSR.

      Application Level View:
        Reset & Interrupts
        Memory system aborts & Undefined instructions
        Supervisor calls (SVCs)     - SVC instruction, supervisor exception, switch to PL1.
        Secure monitor calls (SMCs) - SMC instruction, secure monitor exception (only from PL1 or PL1-defined PL0 methods...).

      Application Level View:
        BKPT - instruction to cause debug event
	DBG - instruction provides hint to debug system
    Checks - ThumbEE extension checks and branches to releavent handlers.
A3. Application Level Memory Model
  32-bit Address space
    Instruction execution or unaligned data access that wraps over (or under) the address space in UNPREDICTABLE
  Alignment
    ARM is 4-byte aligned, Thumb is 2-byte aligned.
    ARMv7 supports some unaligned data access to Normal Memory.
      Other memory types abort with an alignment fault if VMSA, otherwise UNPREDICTABLE.
    SCTLR.A register
      1: Alignment-fault Data Abort exception always
      0: Some unaligned access
        Word and Halfword Load/Store instructions, (T-verion or not) (LDR,LDRT,STR,STRT, etc)
	Table Branch instructions
	PUSH and POP, encodings T3 and A2 only
	Load/Store vector with standard alignment
    Always fault on unaligned access:
      Load/Store multiple (or doubleword, or vector registers), SWP, RFE, SRS
      Exclusive Load/Stores (atomic ops) 
      Load/Stores to Coprocs
      PUSH, POP (also with vector registers) except T3 and A2 encodings
      Load/Store vector with align specified
    PC-loading instructions must produce a word-aligned address
    Unaligned accesses usually take a few additional cycles to complete
  Endianess
    Refers to _per-data-element-wise_ ordering of bytes.
    Instructions: Always little-endian for v7-A, system-level-controllable for v7-R (for legacy code, and...?).
    Reversal Instructions: REV, REV16 (packed halfwords), REVSH (signed halfword reverse)
  Synchronization and semaphores
    (LDREX|STREX)[B|H|D] or CLREX (clear exclusive)
    Loads by atomic-capable observers tag a block of memory for exclusive access and stores clear that tag.
    During a store, if the address has already been updated with a more recent value, then the write doesn't succeed and a flag is set (somewhere?...)
    ...
  Memory Types, Attributes, and Memory Order Model
    Most-significant memory attr
      Normal - Flash ROM, ROM, SRAM, DRAM and DDR memory
        Supports unaligned accesses, access merging, speculative accessing
	Is weakly-ordered meaning that if multi-observers are to observe multiple memory ops in order, then barriers must be explicitly used.
	Shareability attributes on normal memory - define data coherency properties of region
	  Applies to translation table walks only in a MP VMSA arch (so requires LPAE?).
	  Non-shareable Normal Memory
	    If cacheable, it does not ensure coherency across different observers. Cache maintenance ops must be explicitly used.
	  Shareable Normal Memory
	    VMSA - may be Shareable or Outer Shareable
	    PMSA - Shareable and Outer shareable are treated the same.

            Shareable makes independent data access coherent across multiple observers in a processor cluster (with its data and unified cached).
	    Outer Shareable (for VMSA only) extends Sharebility affect across processor clusters.
	Cacheable Normal Memory
	  Modes (Policies)
	    Non-Cacheable
	    Write-Through Cacheable
	      This (along with Non-cacheable) make completed writes from inside or outside the releavent level of cache visible to all inside or outside observers.
	        Writes are immediately and globally coherent?
	    Write-Back Cacheable
	  Cache Allocation Hints
	  Transient or Non-transient attributes (LPAE only) (Applicable to all other cache attributes)
	    Transient restricts allocations to that cache to limit evictions of less-transient (more permenant) data elements.
	  Cacheability attributes apply to observers outside of the Shareability domain.
	  Inner vs Outer Cache - Two conceptual levels of cache.
	    Inner/Outer cache doesn't necessaryily imply Inner/Outer shareability.
	    Inner refers to innermost (cpu-closest and lowest levels of cache).
	    All caches controlled by inner cacheability attrs must lie inside a cache controlled by outer cacheability attr or exist without any outer caches.
      Device and Strongly-ordered
        Accesses are more strict, non-speculative (generally) and non-cacheable.
	  Strict in that accesses occur at program-written size and with program-written number of accesses.
	Used for memory regions for which accesses may cause side-effects or where a value might change across multiple loads.
	Never uses cache.
	These regions are always have Shareable attr (except Device regions on non-LPAE archs)
	  Non-LPAE archs Device regions might implement Shareability attribute but may not. Distinctions between Inner/Outer and Shareable/Nonshareble attrs may also not be respected.
	Device vs. Strongly-ordered
	  Strongly-ordered memory accesses complete only AFTER REACHING the peripheral or memory component accessed.
	  Device memory accesses may complete BEFORE REACHING the destination.
      Memory Access Restrictions
        Memory types, shareability and cacheability attributes must be the same for all accesses generated from a single instruction.
	Unaligned access - On VMSA to Device or strongly-ordered memory, abort with alignment fault. If not VMSA, unpredictable.
	Accesses to device or strongly-ordered memory must not cross a 4KB boundary.
	In PMSA and VMSA (with MMU enabled), loads/store instrs to PC must access only Normal memory. Otherwise unpredictable.
	Instruction fetches must only access normal memory.
	ARM strongly recommends that attributes assigned to a single memory location (across VM aliases for example) are the same.
    Other Attributes
      Shareability - Applicable to normal memory, Device memory is only Inner shareable unless we have LPAE (then also Outer shareable)
      Cacheability - Normal memory only, non-cacheable, write-through cacheable or write-bach cacheable
    Atomicity
      Single-Copy Atomicity - All back-to-back atomic stores that overlap are in coherence order. An atomic load overlapping an atomic store must return
        all data in coherence order of the overlapping load & store bytes.
      Multi-Copy Atomic
        In MP systems, all writes are serialized and observed in the same order by all observers. A read after a write doesn't occur until all observers observe that write.
	Writes to normal memory are not MP atomic.
	Writes to device and strongly-ordered memory that are single-copy atomic are also multi-copy atomic.
      Accesses and Atomicity
        Atomic processor accesses include:
          all byte accesses, all halfword, word if properly aligned.
        	doubleword accesses with LDREXD/STREXD if doubleword aligned
        Multiple-byte access instructions (LDM, STM, PUSH, POP, vector LDM, etc) generate single-copy atomic word-aligned word accesses.
        LPAE LDRD, STRD accesses are 64-bit single-copy atomic as seen by translation table walks and accesses to the tables.
      Atomic sequences and aborts
        Abort from Synchronous abort exceptions
	Abort from IRQ, FIQ and asychronous aborts in low interrupt latency configuration
	  - for asynch aborts, loads' registers are UNKNOWN after abort, except for address generation registers which are restored
	    Locations of stores can contain unknown values
        Upon normal return (prefered return address?) from the exception, the atomic operation is re-executed.
      Implicit Use Summary
        Cache linefills and evictions have no effect on single-copy atomicity
	Instruction fetches are single-copy atomic based on ISA state (ARM, Thumb or Jazelle).
	Translation table walks (and accesses?) are single-copy atomic based on the (Long|Short)-descriptor format.
    Concurrent Instruction Modification with Execution
      ...
A4. Application Level Instruction sets
  Summary and Info
    Thumb
      16-bit or 32-bit, 2-byte aligned
      Most 16-bit instrs can only access R0-R7, only some can access the high 8 registers.
      Most instr-combos requiring 2 16-bit instrs can be done faster with a single 32-bit instr.
    ARM
      32-bit, 4-byte aligned
    Switching ARM/Thumb States
      Both states can switch to other using BX, BLX, or LDR/LDM that loads the PC.
      ARM can additionally switch to Thumb using a larger set of arithmetic instructions that set the PC.
      Prefer 'BX LR' to return from functions.
      Exception entires and returns can also change state.
    Conditional Execution
      ARM and Thumb can conditionally execute instructions based off of the N,Z,C or V flags in the APSR.
      Thumb can only conditionally execute:
        16-bit or 32-bit conditional branch instrs
        CBZ or CBNZ: conditionally branch if zero (or non-zero).
        IT Blocks
      VFP and SIMD instrs
        ...
    Writing to PC (see releavent A2. section on the PC core register)
  UAL (Unified Assembler Language) (gives a standard syntax and rules around instruction mneumonics and general assembler)
    Instruction Selection
      16-bit instruction encodings are prefered over their 32-bit versions.
        This can be overridden in the syntax.
    Conditional Instructions
      IT blocks
        ARM mode processes and checks these but doesn't produce code...
	Conditionally executed instrs in IT blocks must explicitly list their condition and match the condition (or its inverse) specified on the IT instruction itself.
	Not all instructions can be used in an IT block; some can only be used as the last instruction.
	Branch conditional instructions in IT blocks don't use a conditional encoding, they use the IT block surrounding it.
    Labels:
      Usually referenced in a PC-relative manner, referencing off of PC+<arm/thumb word size>
    Common ISA Features
      Mneumonic Suffix Fields (suffix for instruction mneumonics)
        .<C> : execution condition (see list??? ...)
	.<Q> : instr size (only available in Thumb mode) (.N for narrow (16-bit), .W for wide (32-bit))
      Immediate Constants
        Zero-extended 16-bit or modified immediate constant???
  Branch Instrs
    B - branch to target address
    CBZ, CBNZ - compare and branch zero or non-zero
    Branch with Link
      BL, BLX (immediate)
      BLX (register)
    BX (register)

    CP10/CP11 (for VFP and SIMD coprocessor) Seem to use different but still similar CP-related instructions
    Instructions that can't execute on any coprocessor generate an Undefined Instruction Exception.



B1. System Level Programmer's Model
  2. System Concepts and Terms
    States
      Instruction Set State (ARM, Thumb, Jazelle or ThumbEE)
      Execution State (part of PSRs ISA state, IT blocks and endianess)
      Security State (optional but also implied by virtualization)
      Debug State (if halted with intrusive debugging)
    Priviledge Level
      PL0, PL1 and (hypervisor mode only) PL2
    Exceptions
      Destination mode determined by
        Exception type & Source mode
        Also Security and Virtualization configurations
      Types
        Synchronous Exceptions - caused by an instruction and return address is that of the instruction
	Asynchronous Exceptions - not caused by an instruction or the return address points somewhere different from last instruction
	  Processor mode might be able to change after the except. is generated.
	  Precise async except. present processor state consistent with that at the instructions from which the except. was taken.
	  Imprecise async except. present processor state that might be inconsistent with that at the instructions from which the except. was taken.
      Relation to priviledge and security state
        Can never take an except. from a secure mode to a non-secure mode.
	On generation, From PL <= To PL and on returning from except. PL >= returned PL.
	Exceptions from Hyp. mode must go to hyp. mode or secure monitor mode.
  3. Processor Modes and Core Registers
    Modes
      User       (usr) PL0
      FIQ        (fiq)
      IRQ        (irq)
      Supervisor (svc)
      Monitor    (mon)      Secure only
      Abort      (abt)
      Hyp        (hyp) PL2  Non-secure only
      Undef.     (und)
      System     (sys)
    Mode Notes
      usr - unpriviledge access to system; can only change modes with an exception
      sys - priviliedge access to system, same registers as usr; Can't be entered via an exception
      svc - default mode of SVC instr.; entered on reset
      abt - default mode of data or prefetch aborts
      und - instr-related exceptions including UNDEFINED instruction
      fiq - fiq interrupt taken here
      irq - irq interrupt taken here
      hyp - some non-secure exceptions routed here; HVC & hyp. trap are always taken here (can't be generated from secure mode)
      mon - PL1 can issue SMC (secure monitor call) to enter secure monitor mode (always secure); has access to secure and non-secure registers. Only way to change sec state.
  5. Security Extensions
    Adds seperate secure translation regime, many secure banked system registers and a unique Monitor execution mode for switching between secure and non-secure mode.
    Allows for more secure software:
      Prevents non-secure software from accessing memory designated as secure.
      Some system controls are not assessible in non-secure mode.
      Secure transition (from non-secure) is only available through a small set of exceptions.
        - Same for exiting secure state to non-secure state.
      Many OS and hyp operations can be handling without changing security state (reducing transition space and need).
    SCR.NS bit determines secure state (when not in Monitor mode or hyp mode; they have default secure values).
      - monitor mode ignores NS bit; always secure.
    
  8. Exception Handling
    Two Interrupt Schemes (switch with SCTLR.VE (Sec banked as well))
      Single static interrupt base addresses for IRQ nad FIQ that dynamically dispatch based off of the exception type.
      Vectored interrupts for IRQs and FIQs (8-word interrupt address vector starting at an exception vector base address). Dispatch happens in the table.
    Varieties of Vector Tables
      No Security Extensions
        SCTLR.V = 0 selects normal vectors situated at 0x0000_0000
	SCTLR.V = 1 selects high vectors (Hivecs) at 0xFFFF_0000
      Security Extensions
        Monitor vector table    - taken to secure monitor mode and uses secure translation regime.
	Secure vector table     - taken to secure PL1 mode in general (not monitor) and uses secure translation regime.
	Non-secure vector table - taken to non-secure PL1 modes and uses non-secure translation regime.
	Hyp vector table        - taken to non-secure hyp PL2 mode and uses non-secure translation regime.

        Exception Vector Base Addr (as determined by destination mode)
	  Monitor Mode : MVBAR
	  Hyp. Mode : HVBAR (what about SCTLR.V and highvecs?)
	  Other
    	    SCTLR.V = 1 : highvecs
    	    SCTLR.V = 0 :
    	      Non-Secure: 0x0000_0000
    	      Secure: VBAR (VBAR_S in secure mode)

      Exception Priority Order
        Exceptions from Breakpoint debug event or vector catch debug event (address match form); these occur before instruction execution
        Instructions may generate a single Prefetch Abort exception.
	Undefined instr. exception or hyp trap don't access memory and can't cause Data aborts.
	  If an instr generates both an undef instr. exception and hyp trap, then undef instr. has priority (more general undef instr has priority over hyp trap)
	If system call generates undef instr. or hyp trap, then those take priority over system call.
	A memory access that generates MMU (MPU) fault or sync. watchpoint debug event must not generate an external abort.
	All other sync. exceptions from instructions are mutually exclusive.
      Asynchronous Exceptions
        Async except. before context sync. events occur before the first instruction in the new context.
	  Context sync events: ISB instr, taking or returning from an exception, exiting debug state.
	Priority of sync except. over async except is IMP DEF.
	CPSR has mask bits for every type of async except.
	CPSR has async except status bits to indicate the type of exception that was taken.
      Hypervisor Trap/Entry (offset 0x14)
        Hyp Traps
	If coming from a mode != hypvisor mode
	  Hyp call
	  Some general exceptions (from PL0 ???) when HCR.TGE (trap general except.) is set to 1
	  


B3. VMSA (Virtual Memory System Architecture)
  11. Caches
    Data & Unified Caches
      Memory address translation (of VMAs) is entirely transparent to different observers; accesses are fully coherent (without any need for barriers or maintenance).
      Temporal semantics of programs is always respected???
        Writes occur in program order.
	A read before <some op> always returns the last value written there.
	A read before write will never be affected by that write.
      Cache maintenance on physical memory aliases are visable to all aliases of that physical location.
        What of Shareability attrs? Is there only one cache (to function on) for all shareability domains?
      PIPT Caches (physically indexed-physically tagged) implement this behavior.
    Instruction Caches
      Parts and Styles of Caching
        Indexing: uses physical or virtual addresses (to sort through cache)
	Tagging: uses physical or virtual tagging (to uniquely identify a address-cache pair)
      Three different behaviors of instruction caches
        PIPT
	  IVIPT extension implemented: Maintenance on caches only required if instr address is written to.
	  VM translation occurs upstream from the cache so all memory region aliases (of a single PA) benefit from any given cache maintence op.
	VIPT
	  IVIPT extension implemented: Maintenance on caches only required if instr address is written to.
	  Memory address translation still transparent to all instr caches.
	  Cache invalidation that invalidates by a VMA is only visible to that virtual memory alias and may not be visible to others.
	    Only way to make all aliases observe an invalidation of cache is to invalidate all of the cache.
	VIVT (tagged with ASIDs and VMIDs...)
	  Maintenance is required for instr modifications using any VM translation.
	  Maintenance is required for any change in VM translation.
	    Toggling of MMU; changing TLB values; new TLB mappings in SCRs (unless given a relevent ASID or VMID to change with them).
	    Note: Don't need to invalidate cache when writing to mapped instr memory and when considering any single given ASID/VMID & TLB mapping pair. VA-storing cache is always and only ever used.
	      Doesn't apply to VIPT or PIPT since those caches store PA.
	  Cache invalidation that invalidates by a VMA is only visible to that virtual memory alias and may not be visible to others.
	    Only way to make all aliases observe an invalidation of cache is to invalidate all of the cache.
      Cache Maintenance Requirements from changing TLB attrs
        Changing cacheability when:
	  Cacheable -> Non-cacheable
	  Swapping cache modes (write-back or write-through)
	Changing Shareability Requires
	  1. Set to non-cacheable, outer shareable
	  2. Clean and invalidate location from cache
	  3. Set desired shareability
